<h1>About Papertalk</h1>

<p class="lead"><strong>Papertalk</strong> was born from the recognition that <em>there's no good place on the web to discuss, critique, and learn about academic research</em>. Blogs and Twitter are great, but we need somewhere to bring it all together: we believe these discussions will be higher quality and more accessible if they happen in one place.</p>

<p>Papertalk is open and non-profit. We won't "monetize your content", we won't sell your interests and profiles, and we won't do any of the other sketchy things that websites do when they're scrambling to grow and make money. Papertalk will be a good web citizen: we'll follow standards, provide stable links, and all that good stuff.</p>

<p>You own what you write on Papertalk, and you're free to re-post and re-mix at will. You can also export everything you've written in standard formats. Because...it's yours.</p>

<p>Who is Papertalk for?
	<ul>
		<li>Academics who want to keep their finger on the pulse of their own field, and adjacent ones as well - and who want to provide insight, context, and critiques of others' work.</li>
		<li>Anyone with insights into a particular field or piece of work - ex-academics, science bloggers, industry researchers, and all those who have something to contribute to the discussion.</li>
		<li>People who want to learn about scientific research - and who want more depth and insight than you can get from reading either traditional journalistic accounts, and more explanation and context than the original papers.</li>
	</ul>
